All projects were done using PyCharm IDE. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

## irisDatasetMachineLearning

Basic layout of a machine learning project using the Iris dataset. Dataset available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris
This project is a part of my learning in the area of machine learning and I followed guide from the following course: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/

, however, I did some modifications to it as I saw fit.

The code loads up the dataset of Iris flower features and measures the performance of several machine learning algorithms.

## Titanic_machine_learning_project

A project where I apply learnings from the Iris dataset project. The code loads up the titanic dataset, imputes missing data and does basic data preparation. Then, it measures performance of several algorithms and at the end gives you possibility of inputing a name of any person on board to tell you if they survived or not.

It makes the pdictions based on age, sex, and class.

If you want to use the prediction function where you insert the name, you will need the csv or xml file of the Titanic dataset.

## Pneumonia_recognition

My aim with this project is to eventually use R-CNNs to find pneumonia in the lung X-ray images. Very early stage as of now and no functionality.

## 2D_images_to_3D_model

Basic layout of a photogrammetry software. Currently with only very basic functions. Image to grayscale conversion and basic image filtering to find lines and edges. The image is loaded up as a system variable, if you would like to use this code you have to make sure to create the system variable in your system. It should contain the path to the image.

## parallelProcesses

Project for a website scrapper using multithreading and matplotlib to show 20 most common words scrapped from 4 websites.

## exercisesNumpy01

Exercises to practice numpy library and work with .csv files. CSV file used for the exercises was in this case created locally.
